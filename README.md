# M1 Assembly
A collection of all my **ARM64 Assembly** programs I'm coding while _learning_ Assembly.  
I'll try to keep every code well **documented** via in-code comments and README files. 

## Environment
The programs contained in this repository are specifically made to work on **MacOS** and on Macs equipped with any ``Mx 64-bit ARM chip``. _Every program is tested on an M1 Pro 8 CPU-Cores + 14 GPU-Cores_.

I'm using the standard **ARM64 instruction set** and **registers**.

## References  
I got my inspiration from <a href='https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon'>**Hello Silicon**</a> and I'm also using its contents as my **primary reference** to learn Assembly.

ARM64 Assembly documentation I'm using:
* <a href='https://developer.arm.com/documentation/'>Arm Developer</a>
* this summary from <a href='https://cit.dixie.edu/cs/2810/arm64-assembly.html'>Dixie State University</a>
